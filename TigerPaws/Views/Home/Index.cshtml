            <h2>About Tiger Paws</h2>
            <p>
                Tiger Paws is a boutique stuffed toy outlet.
                We started in 2000 after recognising that my 2 year old child absolutely loved her stuffed animals - she just could not get enough!
                The business started as we knew a lot of young mothers and our network was growing all the time,
                and chatting with them shouwed us that there is a big calling for sturred animals.
                We started just working from home, but it became quickly apparent that we would need a physical location to hold stock and as a retail outlet.
                By 2002, we were going great guns with a lage and repeat customer base, and a call for the import of wider variety of toys.
